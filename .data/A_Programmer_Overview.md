# Introduction for Programmers
 
This overview is an index for people intending to develop their own notebooks or use examples from demonstrations to apply to their own BI/ML/AI tools. 

Some may be looking for python, others for SQL examples they can insert into their client tools. There are also general development topics like
using the data dictionary, database query logging, REST API, or submitting demos.

### SQL Programming Information 

#### SQL Basics in Jupyter
This guide will walk you through writing your first SQL queries in Jupyter.  It uses some of the Vantage system tables as a source for the queries.<br>
[SQL Version](../Getting_Started/SQL_Basics_in_Jupyter/SQL_Basics_in_Jupyter_SQL.ipynb)

#### Data Loading (SQL)
Shows multiple ways to load data from local CSV files, and cloud files on Google and AWS using the SQL kernel.<br>

### General Programming Information

#### Data Dictionary
This provides an index to all of the databases used by demo notebooks on this machine, allowing you to use that data for your own notebooks or BI tools.<br>
[Python Version](../UseCases/Data_Dictionary/Data_Dictionary.ipynb)

#### Query Service REST API
Demonstration of using REST API calls to Vantage which is useful for web or mobile applications to access and maintain data.<br>
[Python Version](../UseCases/Query_Service/Query_Service.ipynb)

#### Vantage Query Log Analysis
Analysis of sessions and queries  you executed using the built-in logging facilities of Vantage.<br>
[SQL Version](../UseCases/Vantage_Query_Log_Analysis/Vantage_Query_Log_Analysis_SQL.ipynb)

#### How to Submit Your Demos
It is very easy to submit your demo for publication. Tell us directory with the notebook and referenced files and grant us access to your database.  We'll take it from there.<br>
[Python Version](../Getting_Started/How_to_Submit_Your_Demos/How_to_Submit_Your_Demos.ipynb) &ensp; [Video](./Getting_Started/How_to_Submit_Your_Demos/How_to_Submit_Your_Demos_Video.ipynb)
