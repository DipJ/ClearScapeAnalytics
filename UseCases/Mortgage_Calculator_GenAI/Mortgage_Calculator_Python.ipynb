    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>In the Mortgage Calculator chatbot using Generative AI demo, the combination of <b>RAG, Langchain, and LLM models</b> allows users to ask queries in layman's terms, retrieve relevant information from the Vantage tables, and generate accurate and concise answers based on the retrieved data. This integration of retrieval-based and generative-based approaches provides a powerful tool for extracting knowledge from structured sources and delivering user-friendly responses.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>In this demo we will build Generative Question-Answering using LangChain, a powerful library for working with LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Bloom, etc. and JumpStart in ClearScape notebooks, a system is built where users can ask business questions in natural English and receive answers with data drawn from the relevant databases.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'> &emsp;  &emsp;RAG is a framework that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative-based approaches in question-answering systems.It utilizes both a retrieval model and a generative model to generate high-quality answers to user queries. The retrieval model is responsible for retrieving relevant information from a knowledge source, such as a database or documents. The generative model then takes the retrieved information as input and generates concise and accurate answers in natural language.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'> &emsp;  &emsp; Langchain is a language model developed for understanding and generating human-like text. It is designed to handle queries and requests expressed in everyday language, enabling users to ask questions in layman's terms. Langchain leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to comprehend the semantics and context of user queries. It can process various types of queries, ranging from simple factual questions to complex and nuanced queries.</p>\n",

    "These models, such as GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3),  GPT-3.5, GPT-4, HuggingFace BLOOM, LLaMA, Google's FLAN-T5, etc. are capable of generating human-like text responses. LLM models have been pre-trained on diverse sources of text data, enabling them to learn patterns, grammar, and context from a wide range of topics. They can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as question-answering, natural language understanding, and text generation.\n",
    "LLM models have achieved impressive results in various natural language processing tasks and are widely used in AI applications for generating human-like text responses.</p>"

For example in the context of text-to-SQL, the LangChain SQLAgent will not give up if there is an error in executing the generated SQL.
