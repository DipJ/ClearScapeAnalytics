One kWh produced in Alaska is different from one in California. In addition to that factors may change over different times of the day. The electricity mix is different at noon compared to midnight for optimizing the carbon footprint and working towards net zero, these may be valuable differences to be tracked.\n",

The model is flexible to handle all sort of accreditation levels, units of measurements. It is leveraging ClearScape analytics to deal with time travel, handle geospatial challenges and improve data quality via text analysis functions.<br><br>Now that we got why carbon footprint analytics is needed and what calculations it does let take a look at some of the it's tables and the type of output it generates."

We have seen how the carbon footprint engine works and what are some of the multiple usages that can be done with it. It can really help companies better understanding greenhouse gas emissions and take the best decision possible to decrease their carbon footprint. Based on the emission data generated companies can also build AI/ML models which can predict carbon footprint of a company and they can plan activities for reducing carbon footprint.<br><br>\n",
