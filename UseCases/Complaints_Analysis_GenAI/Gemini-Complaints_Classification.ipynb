       "0  I was forced to sign an IRS document sharing information between the IRS and discover card. I am not legally obliged to do so, and they forced me to close my accounts. They closed my online and app accounts ( on phone and mobile ) and did not allow me to make any further purchases. Being left in the dark for two weeks, I then had my account closed for no reason. They say it's a \" business decision. '' I then have to call in, and the people I spoke to are not even the same team who closed my account. The only way to get in contact with them is by mail. My credit score was also hit due to closing an account on my record. It is absolutely terrible business practices coming from Discover Card. \\n\\nI will follow through and hopefully bring Discover Card to a small claims court.   \n",
