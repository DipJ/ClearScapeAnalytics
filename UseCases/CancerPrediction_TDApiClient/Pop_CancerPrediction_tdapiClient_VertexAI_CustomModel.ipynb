    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and the second highest in terms of mortality rates. Diagnosis of breast cancer is performed when an abnormal lump is found (from self-examination or x-ray) or a tiny speck of calcium is seen (on an x-ray). After a suspicious lump is found, the doctor will conduct a diagnosis to determine whether it is cancerous and, if so, whether it has spread to other parts of the body. Vantage Clearscape Analytics provides us various machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for cancer diagnosis. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, using descriptions that define the characteristics of the cell nuclei.</p> \n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Vertex AI empowers machine learning developers, data scientists, and data engineers to take their projects from ideation to deployment, quickly and cost-effectively. With the Teradata Vantage API_Request feature directly from Vantage, we can connect to these Vertex AI endpoints through a function to do real-time scoring on data. Google provides the Vertex AI Python SDK, which includes TrainingJob classes for training models on the Vertex AI platform. For the workflow, training runs on the Vertex AI platform. The model is then deployed on a Vertex AI online endpoint and on Teradata Vantage.</p>\n",

A VertexAI endpoint was used to orchestrate model training and deploy the solution’s ML model. Also the model can be stored in Vantage and then used to score in Vantage. Vantage and ClearScape Anlaytics has helped drastically reduce data preparation, model development, and testing time, while allowing for much more frequent and iterative testing and tuning to ensure maximum life-critical accuracy.</p>\n"
