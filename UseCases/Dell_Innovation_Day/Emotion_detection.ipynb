During my entire membership with Discover, I was never late with payments, and always stayed under my credit line, and never charged my credit card for any purposes other than making a legitimate purchase. \\n\\nAbout a month ago, without any notice in advance, Discover closed my account and thereby wiped out my existing cashback rewards of {$300.00}. I contacted the company and demanded for an explanation. However, the only reason I got is \" we are no longer able to meet your servicing needs '', and I was told the rewards will be mailed to me in a check. Now, after 6 weeks, I still have n't received any check from Discover regarding my rewards. \\n\\nI respectfully urge the CFPB to take this matter seriously and to look into this case.
