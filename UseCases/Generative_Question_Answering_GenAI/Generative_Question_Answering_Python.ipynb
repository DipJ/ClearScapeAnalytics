This integration of retrieval-based and generative-based approaches provides a powerful tool for extracting knowledge from structured sources and delivering user-friendly responses.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'> &emsp;  &emsp;RAG is a framework that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative-based approaches in question-answering systems.It utilizes both a retrieval model and a generative model to generate high-quality answers to user queries. The retrieval model is responsible for retrieving relevant information from a knowledge source, such as a database or documents. The generative model then takes the retrieved information as input and generates concise and accurate answers in natural language.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'> &emsp;  &emsp; LangChain is a framework that facilitates the integration and chaining of large language models to other tools and sources to build more sophisticated AI applications. Langchain provides a standard way of communicating with a variety of LLMâ€™s including OpenAI and HuggingFace. Langchain leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to comprehend the semantics and context of user queries. It helps process various types of queries, ranging from simple factual questions to complex and nuanced queries.</p>\n",

LLM models have been pre-trained on diverse sources of text data, enabling them to learn patterns, grammar, and context from a wide range of topics. They can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as question-answering, natural language understanding, and text generation.\n",
