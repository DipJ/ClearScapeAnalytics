The retrieval model is responsible for retrieving relevant information from a knowledge source, such as a database or documents. The generative model then takes the retrieved information as input and generates concise and accurate answers in natural language.</p>\n",

It is designed to handle queries and requests expressed in everyday language, enabling users to ask questions in layman's terms. Langchain leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to comprehend the semantics and context of user queries. It can process various types of queries, ranging from simple factual questions to complex and nuanced queries.</p>\n",

LLM models have been pre-trained on diverse sources of text data, enabling them to learn patterns, grammar, and context from a wide range of topics. They can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as question-answering, natural language understanding, and text generation.\n",
