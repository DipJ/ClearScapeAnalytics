The second had a pre-payment penalty before making 12 payments starting XX/XX/XXXX. The property was sold in XX/XX/XXXX.\\n\\nI recieved a mortgage statement for XX/XX/XXXX that clearly states no pre-payment penalty on the statement.\\n\\nI was charged a {$480.00} pre-payment penalty. I called discover and they told me that if I was refinancing I would not have a penalty. But selling the property I do have penalty.??? My paperwork says no pre-payment penalty after 12 months of payments. Which I did make. This is rubbish trying to pass the buck based on tricky language. Either you have a pre-payment penalty or you do not. I did as my paperwork said, and reflected on my most recent statement. Please send payment to me accordingly.
