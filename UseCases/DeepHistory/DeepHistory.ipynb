    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Teradata Vantage provides unmatched concurrency and performance for the world's largest and most demanding enterprises to analyze their data. Analysis and concurrency needs for older information is generally substantially less as data ages, and over time there is much more history data that accumulates than current 'hot' data, it makes sense to store it somewhere that has different performance and price characteristics: for example an object store such as Amazon S3 or Azure Blob storage.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Keeping historical and current data in separate systems can make it a challenge to gain unique insights that are possible only by analyzing the information together. But not any longer. Now, Teradata Vantage can be used to seamlessly join together all the historical and current information across the data warehouse AND object storage, without having to change the basic data structures and queries. This makes it possible to cost-effectively answer questions that could not be previously addressed so decision makers can better plan for the future.</p>"
