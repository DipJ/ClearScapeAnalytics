    "Vantage Analytics Library (VAL) is a set of over 50 functions for analyzing data content, performing hypothesis tests and executing advanced analytics. Teradata has been evolving the sophistication of these tools for decades and has now packaged the functionality into a library that is accessed for in-database execution by a stored procedure call.   The stored procedure is passed the name of a function, a list of columns and a set of parameters for the function. \n",

    "- Using the R package tdplyr\n",
    "   \n",
    "With VAL, you perform complex processing of the data in the database where it is stored instead of the time and complexity involved in exporting the data out of the database and having a client platform with enough storage and processing capacity to perform the analysis. \n",
