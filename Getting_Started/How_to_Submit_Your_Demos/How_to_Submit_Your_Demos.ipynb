    "Your demonstration may use multiple files and/or your Jupyter notebook may include graphics. It is best to create a directory for your demonstration and put all of the files including the notebook within that directory. We generally make the directory name the same as the Jupyter Notebook, but without the .ipynb suffix.  Example:\n",
    "-    UseCases\n",
    "-        ...\n",
    "-        My_Demo\n",
    "-            My_Demo.ipynb\n",

    "## Suggested Outline Of Your Notebook\n",
    "- It is best to start with a paragraph describing the business situation and how this demonstration addresses that business situation.\n",
    "- If your notebook has more than a few steps, provide a high level outline of the steps you will be going through. This is high level.  Each step in the notebook may take multiple queries or code blocks. \n",
    "- Provide a description before each code block of what that code block will be doing. If your notebook is more than 20 steps, you may want to put a heading from your high level overview of the notebook using the markdown ## marker before that step name so the user can easily jump to areas of interest\n",
    "- If you have reference information about the functions or citations of the data source or algorithms, include a list of those citations at the end of your notebook\n",
    "- Finally, you may want to list yourself as the author and provide the reader a little background about you. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Organizing The Data Used In Your Demo\n",
    "<b>Let's keep this simple.</b> Create a database under demo_user that has your tables, views, and any other objects needed for your notebook.  Example:\n",
