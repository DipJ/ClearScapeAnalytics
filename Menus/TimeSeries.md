* [Air Passenger Forecasting](../UseCases/AirPassengersTimeSeriesForecasting/AirPassengersTimeSeriesForecasting.ipynb)
<br>This demo will show how to use the ARIMA model to predict passenger volume.  ARIMA(Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) is a combination of 2 models AR(Auto Regressive) and MA(Moving Average). It has 3 hyperparameters - P(auto regressive lags), d(order of differentiation), Q(moving avg.) which respectively comes from the AR, I and MA components. The AR part is correlation between previous and current time periods. To smooth out the noise, the MA part is used. The I part binds together the AR and MA parts.<br><br>
 
* [Time Series Analysis of Consumer Complaints Using SQL and visualization](../UseCases/TimeSeriesAnalysis/TimeSeriesAnalysis.ipynb)
<br>Time Series Analysis - Analyzing Consumer Complaints Over Time.  Statistical tests provide a means of testing whether the outcome of an experiment could have been accidental. Numerous tests are provided in-database, all of the hypothesis testing variety<br><br>
 
* [Timeseries and Temporal Analysis of NYC Taxi Data](../UseCases/NYC-taxi-4d/NYC-taxi-timeseries.ipynb)
<br>This notebook explores ClearScape Analytics capability to support temporal algebra, timeseries and temporal tables.<br><br>
