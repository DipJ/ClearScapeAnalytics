* [Energy Consumption Forecasting](../UseCases/Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM/Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM.ipynb)
<br>In this demo we demonstrate how the full lifecycle of consumption forecast can be implemented using Vantage technologies and specifically, the combination of Bring Your Own Model (BYOM), Vantage Analytics Library (VAL) and teradataml python client library solution.</br>
 
* [Sensor Data Analytics from Object Storage with SQL](../UseCases/IndoorSensor/IndoorSensor.ipynb)
<br>In this demo, we will explore using Python to leverage 4D Analytics in Teradata Vantage using the teradataml package. We will use a combination of data that is stored in the Vantage SQL engine and data coming directly from a cloud object store. We will connect to Vantage and explore a sensor dataset provided by the Intel Berkeley Research Lab.</br>
