* [Battery Defect Analysis Using Cloud Data](../UseCases/Manufacturing Defects/ManufacturingDefects.ipynb)
<br>This demo uses local tables to narrow down a problem with battery defects in automobiles, then uses battery production data low cost cloud storage to narrow down the root cause of the failures.<br><br>
 
* [Energy Consumption Forecasting](../Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM/Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM.ipynb)
<br>In this demo we demonstrate how the full lifecycle of consumption forecast can be implemented using Vantage technologies and specifically, the combination of Bring Your Own Model (BYOM), Vantage Analytics Library (VAL) and teradataml python client library solution.<br><br>
 
* [Energy Consumption Forecasting BYOM](../UseCases/Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM/Energy_Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM.ipynb)
<br>For energy trading companies, forecasting of electricity consumption is one key driver in building a successful business. Proper forecasting of market demand prevents losses (in case of overselling energy to market) as well as lost profits (in case of underestimating of demand). In this demo we demonstrate how the full lifecycle of consumption forecast can be implemented using Vantage technologies and specifically, the combination of Bring Your Own Model (BYOM), Vantage Analytics Library (VAL) and teradataml python client library solution.<br><br>
 
* [Sensor Data Analytics from Object Storage with SQL](../UseCases/IndoorSensor/IndoorSensor.ipynb)
<br>In this demo, we will explore using Python to leverage 4D Analytics in Teradata Vantage using the teradataml package. We will use a combination of data that is stored in the Vantage SQL engine and data coming directly from a cloud object store. We will connect to Vantage and explore a sensor dataset provided by the Intel Berkeley Research Lab.<br><br>
