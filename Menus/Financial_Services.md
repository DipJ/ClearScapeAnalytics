* [Credit Card Data Cleansing and Feature Engineering](../UseCases/CreditCardFraud/CreditCardFraud.ipynb)
<br>In a typical Data Science project there are multiple preprocessing steps involved to process the raw incoming data before it can actually be used in a model for predictions. On an estimate about 70-80% of the time and effort goes into the pre-processing steps. With the help of Vantage's in Db functions we can perform these functions very effectively and at scale. In this demo notebook we are using a sample financial data of credit card application with target of loan defaulters, we will go through the general preprocessing steps that are involved in getting the source data and making the data useable  for model creation.<br><br>
 
* [Data Prep and Transformation at Scale with Python and Vantage](../UseCases/DataPrepAndDiscovery/DataPrepAndDiscovery.ipynb)
<br>Lengthy notebook that reviews data management, data discovery, and basic transformations as part of the analytics lifecycle, using teradataml and python pandas data.  Demo uses fake Financial Transaction and customer data.

Use cases include: 
1. Create and Load Tables from source data sets. 
2. Basic Data Discovery. Metadata and feature analysis 
3. Working with Data - aggregations, joins, and basic transformations. 
4. Advanced Data Preparation - column assignments using complex functions. 
5. Visualizing results with Open-Source tools.<br><br>
 
* [Financial Services Customer Journey](../UseCases/FSCustomerJourney/FSCustomerJourney.ipynb)
<br>In this use case we will show several different analytic techniques to analyze various aspects of a customer journey using Vantage. Specifically we will use the Attribution and nPath functions.  Starting with customer acquisition, how do we:
- Find new customers
- Measure marketing attribution
- How can we increase ROI and maximize marketing effectiveness, minimize the time to conversion.<br><br>
 
* [Fraud Detection using BYOM with Python and Scoring in Vantage](../UseCases/GLM_Fraud_Detection_BYOM/GLM_Fraud_Detection_BYOM.ipynb)
<br>In recent years we have seen a huge increase in Fraud attempts, making fraud detection necessary for Banking and Financial Institutions.  This notebook provides a demonstration of "data science workflow" that illustrates how to leverage Vantage's Bring Your Own Model to build model in python and score the model at scale in Vantage. Users perform the large-scale operations such as feature analysis, data transformation, and ML Model Scoring in the Vantage environment without having to move data.<br><br>
 
* [In-database Fraud Detection using GLM Predict](../UseCases/GLM_Fraud_Detection_SQLE/GLM_Fraud_Detection_SQL.ipynb)
<br>In recent years we have seen a huge increase in Fraud attempts, making fraud detection necessary for Banking and Financial Institutions. This notebook provides a demonstration of "data science workflow" that illustrates how to leverage Vantage's ClearScape Analytics to build, validate and score a model at scale in Vantage without moving the data.<br><br>
 
* [Insurance Policy Claims](../UseCases/InsurancePolicyClaims/InsurancePolicyClaims.ipynb)
<br>This notebook shows how Temporal features of Vantage can dramatically simplify applications and provide BiTemporal capabilities for "AS IS"/"AS WAS" reporting based on when the update was valid or when it was known.  In this case, insurance policies may have changes impacting cost and risk exposure. Some databases provide "Time Travel" with substantial time limits.  A simple prefix to SQL statements is used to control the time perspective of the query.<br><br>
 
* [Time Series Analysis of Consumer Complaints Using SQL and visualization](../UseCases/TimeSeriesAnalysis/TimeSeriesAnalysis.ipynb)
<br>Time Series Analysis - Analyzing Consumer Complaints Over Time.  Statistical tests provide a means of testing whether the outcome of an experiment could have been accidental. Numerous tests are provided in-database, all of the hypothesis testing variety<br><br>
