* [Introduction to NOS using SQL](#) ... (coming soon)
<br>The following is a summary of how to access different formats of data stored in an external object store. You can copy and modify the example queries below to access your own datasets. For simplicity the included datasets are setup to not need credentials</br>
 
* [Battery Defect Analysis Using Cloud Data](../UseCases/Manufacturing Defects/ManufacturingDefects.ipynb)
<br>This demo uses local tables to narrow down a problem with battery defects in automobiles, then uses battery production data low cost cloud storage to narrow down the root cause of the failures.</br>
 
* [Deep History - Offloading cold historical data to Object Store](../UseCases/DeepHistory/DeepHistory.ipynb)
<br>Keeping historical and current data in separate systems can make it a challenge to gain unique insights that are possible only by analyzing the information together. But not any longer. Now, Teradata Vantage can be used to seamlessly join together all the historical and current information across the data warehouse AND object storage, without having to change the basic data structures and queries.</br>
 
* [End to End data pipelines using Python and NOS - Downloadable Demo Overview](#) ... (coming soon)<img src="../UseCases/DeepHistory/NOS_Icon.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; height: 50px; width: auto;" />
<br>Shows two demos - write NOS then read using open source tools.  Demo 2 - write using simulated machine sensor to object store, then read_nos</br>
 
* [Accessing Deep History (Sales Data) using NOS and SQL](#) ... (coming soon)
<br>Offloading cold historical data to an object store</br>
 
* [Sensor Data Analytics from Object Storage with SQL](../UseCases/IndoorSensor/IndoorSensor.ipynb)
<br>In this demo, we will explore using Python to leverage 4D Analytics in Teradata Vantage using the teradataml package. We will use a combination of data that is stored in the Vantage SQL engine and data coming directly from a cloud object store. We will connect to Vantage and explore a sensor dataset provided by the Intel Berkeley Research Lab.</br>
