* [Battery Defect Analysis Using Cloud Data](../UseCases/ManufacturingDefects/ManufacturingDefects.ipynb)
<br>This demo uses local tables to narrow down a problem with battery defects in automobiles, then uses battery production data low cost cloud storage to narrow down the root cause of the failures.<br><br>
 
* [Deep History - Offloading cold historical data to Object Store](../UseCases/DeepHistory/DeepHistory.ipynb)
<br>Keeping historical and current data in separate systems can make it a challenge to gain unique insights that are possible only by analyzing the information together. But not any longer. Now, Teradata Vantage can be used to seamlessly join together all the historical and current information across the data warehouse AND object storage, without having to change the basic data structures and queries.<br><br>
 
* [Sensor Data Analytics from Object Storage with SQL](../UseCases/IndoorSensor/IndoorSensor.ipynb)
<br>In this demo, we will explore using Python to leverage 4D Analytics in Teradata Vantage using the teradataml package. We will use a combination of data that is stored in the Vantage SQL engine and data coming directly from a cloud object store. We will connect to Vantage and explore a sensor dataset provided by the Intel Berkeley Research Lab.<br><br>
