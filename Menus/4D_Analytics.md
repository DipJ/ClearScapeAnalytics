* [Sensor Data Analytics from Object Storage with SQL](../UseCases/IndoorSensor/IndoorSensor.ipynb)
<br>In this demo, we will explore using Python to leverage 4D Analytics in Teradata Vantage using the teradataml package. We will use a combination of data that is stored in the Vantage SQL engine and data coming directly from a cloud object store. We will connect to Vantage and explore a sensor dataset provided by the Intel Berkeley Research Lab.</br>
