* [Insurance Policy Claims](../UseCases/InsurancePolicyClaims/InsurancePolicyClaims.ipynb)
<br>This notebook shows how Temporal features of Vantage can dramatically simplify applications and provide BiTemporal capabilities for "AS IS"/"AS WAS" reporting based on when the update was valid or when it was known.  In this case, insurance policies may have changes impacting cost and risk exposure. Some databases provide "Time Travel" with substantial time limits.  A simple prefix to SQL statements is used to control the time perspective of the query.<br><br>
