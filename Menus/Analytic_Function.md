* [Air Passenger Forecasting](../UseCases/AirPassengersTimeSeriesForecasting/AirPassengersTimeSeriesForecasting.ipynb)
<br>This demo will show how to use the ARIMA model to predict passenger volume.  ARIMA(Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) is a combination of 2 models AR(Auto Regressive) and MA(Moving Average). It has 3 hyperparameters - P(auto regressive lags), d(order of differentiation), Q(moving avg.) which respectively comes from the AR, I and MA components. The AR part is correlation between previous and current time periods. To smooth out the noise, the MA part is used. The I part binds together the AR and MA parts.<br><br>
 
* [Customer Behavior Analysis and Visualization with Python](../UseCases/CustomerBehaviorAnalysis/Behavioral Analysis.ipynb)
<br>Uses ClearScape Analytic functions to demonstrate how to analyze user behaviors over time.  Visualize the results using plotly for sankey charts<br><br>
 
* [Data Science 101 with Python](../UseCases/DataScienceFlow/DataScienceFlow.ipynb)
<br>In this Jupyter Notebook, we will walk you through the standard flow of Data Science using the CRISP-DM standard (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining):
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment<br><br>
 
* [Fourier Transforms for in-database Signal Processing](../UseCases/FourierTransform/FourierTransform.ipynb)
<br>This notebook demonstrates the ClearScape Analytics UAF functions to process signal data to identify patterns and remove noise.<br><br>
 
* [Parkinson's Disease Prediction Using Decision Forest](../UseCases/Parkinsons_Disease/Parkinsons_Disease_Classification.ipynb)
<br>This is an analysis of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice recording from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "status" column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD<br><br>
 
* [Text Term Frequency Analysis - Python](../UseCases/TextProcessing_TF_IDF/TF_IDF_Workflow.ipynb)
<br>This demo will analyze  the text in rows of the table to find the TF-IDF or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency is an indicator of a term's importance in a specific document based on the entire corpus of documents. This one is uses a Python notebook<br><br>
 
* [Text Term Frequency Analysis - SQL](../UseCases/TextProcessing_TF_IDF/TF_IDF_Workflow_SQL.ipynb)
<br>This demo will analyze  the text in rows of the table to find the TF-IDF or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency is an indicator of a term's importance in a specific document based on the entire corpus of documents. This one is uses a SQL notebook<br><br>
