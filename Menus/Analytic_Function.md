* [Energy Consumption Forecasting](../UseCases/Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM/Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM.ipynb)
<br>In this demo we demonstrate how the full lifecycle of consumption forecast can be implemented using Vantage technologies and specifically, the combination of Bring Your Own Model (BYOM), Vantage Analytics Library (VAL) and teradataml python client library solution.</br>
 
* [Text Term Frequency Analysis - SQL](../UseCases/TextProcessing_TF_IDF/TF_IDF_Workflow_SQL.ipynb)
<br>This demo will analyse the text in rows of the table to find the TF-IDF or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency is an indicator of a term's importance in a specific document based on the entire corpus of documents. This one is uses a SQL notebook</br>
  
* [Parkinsons Disease Prediction Using Decision Forest](../UseCases/Parkinsons_Disease/Parkinsons_Disease.ipynb)
<br>This is an analysis of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice recording from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "status" column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD</br>
 
* [Manufacturing Defect Analysis from Data Lake Object Storage with SQL](#) ... (coming soon)
<br>You are an analyst at a major auto manufacturer. While running regular financial reports on Teradata Vantage we have discovered a serious business issue with increasing warranty repairs:</br>
 
* [Text Term Frequency Analysis - Python](../UseCases/TextProcessing_TF_IDF/TF_IDF_Workflow.ipynb)
<br>This demo will analyse the text in rows of the table to find the TF-IDF or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency is an indicator of a term's importance in a specific document based on the entire corpus of documents. This one is uses a Python notebook</br>
 
* [Basics of the Teradataml Python Package](../UseCases/Python_Teradataml_Basics/Python_Teradataml_Basics.ipynb)
<br>This reviews the basic capabilities of the teradataml package for Vantage: 
1. Connecting to Vantage 
2. Teratada DataFrames 
3. Aggregation, Transformations, and joins. 
4. Export to Pandas</br>
 
* [Text Preparation and Analysis with Vantage and Python](#) ... (coming soon)
<br>Uses SQLE and demo "product review" data to shwo ngram splitter function, and uses SQL to create a tf-idf score for the terms, and visualizes them by importance</br>
 
* [Customer Behavior Analysis and Visualization with Python](../UseCases/Behavioral Analysis/Behavioral Analysis.ipynb)
<br>Uses SQLE functions to demonstrate how to analyze user behaviors over time.  Visualize the results using plotly for sankey charts</br>
 
* [Data Science 101 with Python](../UseCases/DataScienceFlow/DataScienceFlow.ipynb)
<br>In this Jupyter Notebook, we will walk you through the standard flow of Data Science using the CRISP-DM standard (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining):
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment</br>
 
* [Air Passenger Forecasting](../UseCases/AirPassengersTimeSeriesForecasting/AirPassengersTimeSeriesForecasting.ipynb)
<br>This demo will show how to use the ARIMA model to predict passenger volume.  ARIMA(Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) is a combination of 2 models AR(Auto Regressive) and MA(Moving Average). It has 3 hyperparameters - P(auto regressive lags), d(order of differentiation), Q(moving avg.) which respectively comes from the AR, I and MA components. The AR part is correlation between prev and current time periods. To smooth out the noise, the MA part is used. The I part binds together the AR and MA parts.</br>
 
* [COIVD Risk Modeling and Simulation with SQL and Python](#) ... (coming soon)
<br>Simulation, What-if-Analysis, Risk Calculation using Social Network analysis</br>
