* [Credit Card Data Cleansing and Feature Engineering](../UseCases/CreditCardFraud/CreditCardFraud.ipynb)
<br>In a typical Data Science project there are multiple preprocessing steps involved to process the raw incoming data before it can actually be used in a model for predictions. On an estimate about 70-80% of the time and effort goes into the pre-processing steps. With the help of Vantage's in Db functions we can perform these functions very effectively and at scale. In this demo notebook we are using a sample financial data of credit card application with target of loan defaulters, we will go through the general preprocessing steps that are involved in getting the source data and making the data useable  for model creation.<br><br>
 
* [Energy Consumption Forecasting](../Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM/Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM.ipynb)
<br>In this demo we demonstrate how the full lifecycle of consumption forecast can be implemented using Vantage technologies and specifically, the combination of Bring Your Own Model (BYOM), Vantage Analytics Library (VAL) and teradataml python client library solution.<br><br>
 
* [Energy Consumption Forecasting BYOM](../UseCases/Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM/Energy_Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM.ipynb)
<br>For energy trading companies, forecasting of electricity consumption is one key driver in building a successful business. Proper forecasting of market demand prevents losses (in case of overselling energy to market) as well as lost profits (in case of underestimating of demand). In this demo we demonstrate how the full lifecycle of consumption forecast can be implemented using Vantage technologies and specifically, the combination of Bring Your Own Model (BYOM), Vantage Analytics Library (VAL) and teradataml python client library solution.<br><br>
 
* [Overview Of Vantage Analytics Library](../UseCases/VantageAnalyticLibrary/Overview_Vantage_Analytic_Library.ipynb)
<br>Vantage Analytics Library (VAL) is a set of over 50 functions for analyzing data content, performing hypothesis tests and executing advanced analytics. Teradata has been evolving the sophistication of these tools for decades and has now packaged the functionality into a library that is accessed for in-database execution by a stored procedure call. This notebook describes the general functionality and links to a video with an overview.<br><br>
 
* [VAL Analytic Algorithms and Scoring](../UseCases/VantageAnalyticLibrary/VAL-Analytic_Algorithms_and_Scoring.ipynb)
<br>This notebook demonstrates the use of Vantage Analytic Library Scoring and Analytic Function:
- Matrix Building
- Linear Regression
- Factor Analysis - PCA
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- K-Means Clustering
- Association Rules/Sequence Analysis<br><br>
 
* [VAL Descriptive Statistics and Transformation SQL functions](../UseCases/VantageAnalyticLibrary/VAL-Descriptive_Statistics_and_Transformation.ipynb)
<br>This notebook demonstrates the use Descriptive Statistics and Data Transformation Functions which are useful for the initial processing of data to understand its makeup:
- Values analysis (data types, count, nulls/positive/negative)
- Univariate Statistical Analysis (Min, max, mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, quantiles, etc)
- Distribution analysis
- Histograms
- Text field analysis (analyze data to determine type, numeric/UNICODE analysis)<br><br>
 
* [VAL Hypothesis Test SQL functions](../UseCases/VantageAnalyticLibrary/VAL-Hypothesis_Tests.ipynb)
<br>Statistical tests provide a means of testing whether the outcome of an experiment could have been accidental. Numerous tests are provided in-database, all of the hypothesis testing variety. These include 18 tests grouped under:
- Parametric Tests
- Binomial Test
- Kolmogorov/Smirnoff Tests
- Rank Tests<br><br>
 
* [VAL teradataml Demo](../UseCases/VantageAnalyticLibrary/VAL-teradataml-Demo.ipynb)
<br>This notebook shows the power of Vantage and the Analytic Library through a series of functions that use the Teradata SQLE to perform descriptive statistics, data engineering and transformation, model building, model evaluation and model scoring. All Analytic Library functions are called through Python using the teradataml interfaces for VAL. This notebook covers a subset of the function demonstrated in the other 3 VAL  SQL notebooks, but implemented with Python.<br><br>
