* [Overview of Vantage Analytic Library in Python](#) ... (coming soon)
<br>This notebook shows the power of Vantage and the Analytic Library through a series of functions that use the Teradata SQLE to perform descriptive statistics, data engineering and transformation, model building, model evaluation and model scoring. All Anal</br>
 
* [VAL Hypothesis Test SQL functions](../UseCases/VantageAnalyticLibrary/VAL-Hypothesis_Tests.ipynb)
<br>Statistical tests provide a means of testing whether the outcome of an experiment could have been accidental. Numerous tests are provided in-database, all of the hypothesis testing variety. These include 18 tests grouped under:
- Parametric Tests
- Binomial Test
- Kolmogorov/Smirnoff Tests
- Rank Tests</br>
 
* [VAL Descriptive Statistics and Transformation SQL functions](../UseCases/VantageAnalyticLibrary/VAL-Descriptive_Statistics_and_Transformation.ipynb)
<br>This notebook demonstrates the use Descriptive Statistics and Data Transformation Functions which are useful for the initial processing of data to understand its makeup:
- Values analysis (data types, count, nulls/positive/negative)
- Univariate Statistical Analysis (Min, max, mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, quantiles, etc)
- Distribution analysis
- Histograms
- Text field analysis (analyze data to determine type, numeric/UNICODE analysis)</br>
 
* [VAL teradataml Demo](../UseCases/VantageAnalyticLibrary/VAL-teradataml-Demo.ipynb)
<br>This notebook shows the power of Vantage and the Analytic Library through a series of functions that use the Teradata SQLE to perform descriptive statistics, data engineering and transformation, model building, model evaluation and model scoring. All Analytic Library functions are called through Python using the teradataml interfaces for VAL. This notebook covers a subset of the function demonstrated in the other 3 VAL  SQL notebooks, but implemented with Python.</br>
 
* [VAL Analytic Algorithms and Scoring](../UseCases/VantageAnalyticLibrary/VAL-Analytic_Algorithms_and_Scoring.ipynb)
<br>This notebook demonstrates the use of Vantage Analytic Library Scoring and Analytic Function:
- Matrix Building
- Linear Regression
- Factor Analysis - PCA
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- K-Means Clustering
- Association Rules/Sequence Analysis</br>
