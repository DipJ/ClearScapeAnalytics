* [Vertex AI Integration](../UseCases/vertex_pipelines_housing_example-BYOM/vertex_pipelines_housing_example-BYOM.ipynb)
<br>Vertex AI is Google's single environment for data scientists to develop and deploy ML models, from experimentation, to deployment, to managing and monitoring models. In this tutorial, we will show how to integrate Vantage Analytics capabilities  in Vertex AI ML Pipelines<br><br>
 
* [Dataiku](../UseCases/BI_Tools/Dataiku.ipynb)
<br>Teradata integration with Dataiku provides data preparation and analytic capabilities that make it easier for Dataiku users to harness the scale and function of ClearScape Analytics, whether working with Dataiku visual recipes or coding in R or Python in Dataiku notebooks.  Dataiku end-users now have an easy-to-use interface for Vantage Analytic functions and can tie them directly into the data science workflow. These users do not need to know the syntax of the underlying Vantage analytic functions. Instead, the plugins take the Dataiku end-user configuration and send this back to the Vantage system for processing analytics at scale.<br><br>
