* [Air Passenger Forecasting](../UseCases/AirPassengersTimeSeriesForecasting/AirPassengersTimeSeriesForecasting.ipynb)
<br>This demo will show how to use the ARIMA model to predict passenger volume.  ARIMA(Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) is a combination of 2 models AR(Auto Regressive) and MA(Moving Average). It has 3 hyperparameters - P(auto regressive lags), d(order of differentiation), Q(moving avg.) which respectively comes from the AR, I and MA components. The AR part is correlation between previous and current time periods. To smooth out the noise, the MA part is used. The I part binds together the AR and MA parts.<br><br>
 
* [Energy Consumption Forecasting](../Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM/Consumption_Forecasting_BYOM.ipynb)
<br>In this demo we demonstrate how the full lifecycle of consumption forecast can be implemented using Vantage technologies and specifically, the combination of Bring Your Own Model (BYOM), Vantage Analytics Library (VAL) and teradataml python client library solution.<br><br>
 
* [Fraud Detection using BYOM with Python and Scoring in Vantage](../UseCases/MoneyMuleDetection/GLM_Fraud_Detection_BYOM.ipynb)
<br>In recent years we have seen a huge increase in Fraud attempts, making fraud detection necessary for Banking and Financial Institutions.  This notebook provides a demonstration of "data science workflow" that illustrates how to leverage Vantage's Bring Your Own Model to build model in python and score the model at scale in Vantage. Users perform the large-scale operations such as feature analysis, data transformation, and ML Model Scoring in the Vantage environment without having to move data.<br><br>
 
* [In-database Fraud Detection using GLM Predict](../UseCases/GLM_Fraud_Detection_SQLE/GLM_Fraud_Detection_SQL.ipynb)
<br>In recent years we have seen a huge increase in Fraud attempts, making fraud detection necessary for Banking and Financial Institutions. This notebook provides a demonstration of "data science workflow" that illustrates how to leverage Vantage's ClearScape Analytics to build, validate and score a model at scale in Vantage without moving the data.<br><br>
 
* [Vertex AI Integration](../UseCases/vertex_pipelines_housing_example-BYOM/vertex_pipelines_housing_example-BYOM.ipynb)
<br>Vertex AI is Google's single environment for data scientists to develop and deploy ML models, from experimentation, to deployment, to managing and monitoring models. In this tutorial, we will show how to integrate Vantage Analytics capabilities  in Vertex AI ML Pipelines<br><br>
