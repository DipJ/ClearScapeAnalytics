* [Python Parallel Processing for Data Movement and Model Training - Downloadable Demo Overview](#) ... (coming soon)
<br>Uses various python techniques to introduce parallel and distributed processing concepts, including Teradata Fastload/fastexport.  Also shows an example of distribued processing for ml model training outside of Vantage</br>
 
* [Money Mule Detection using BYOM with Python and Scoring in Vantage](../UseCases/GLM_Fraud_Detection_BYOM/GLM_Fraud_Detection_BYOM.ipynb)
<br>Demo uses the Vantage PMMLPredict function to score a Logistic Regression model that has been trained using an open-source python package sklearn.  Data for the demo is fake money transfer logs and is used to identify fraudulent transactions.</br>
